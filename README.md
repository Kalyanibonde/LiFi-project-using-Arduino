# LiFi-project-using-Arduino

This project demonstrates a simple LiFi communication system using Arduino, LEDs, and light sensors to transmit and receive data.

## Features
- Transmitter: Converts data to modulated light signals.
- Receiver: Decodes light signals into readable data.
- Simple and scalable prototype for LiFi communication.

## Requirements
- Arduino Uno/Nano (x2)
- LED and LDR/Photodiode
- Resistors, Breadboard, Jumper Wires

## Setup
1. Upload the `transmitter.ino` to the transmitter Arduino.
2. Upload the `receiver.ino` to the receiver Arduino.
3. Assemble the circuits as described in their respective `README.md`.

## Usage
- Use the Serial Monitor/cell mobile to input and view data.
